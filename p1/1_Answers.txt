1.
(A) Recieves a number from 1 to 9 from the user and then if it is equal to 5 it will output correct and wrong if it is not equal to 5
(B) Recieves a number from the user and then prints out the increments of 1 from 1 until that number. Can swap out the while loop for a 
for loop.
(C) Takes in two integers using functions and then outputs the sum of squares of the two integers.

2.
(A) No need for any forward declarations as none of them call each other.
(B) 2, 3, 4, 5 require forward declarations.
(C) No functions require forward declarations.
(D) The 2nd, 3rd and 4th functions require forward declarations because the 1st function is calling it. The 5th doesn't require
forward declarations.
(E) Only the 5th Function require forward declarations as the 2, 3, 4 comes before. There is no difficulty in the 2,3,4 programs 
in calling the 1st.
